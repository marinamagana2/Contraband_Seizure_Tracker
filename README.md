# ðŸš¨ Contraband Seizure Tracker

This is a data dashboard I built to explore drug and weapon seizures along U.S. borders. It pulls from real CBP data (2019â€“2025) and lets you track where and when these seizures happened.

Itâ€™s interactive, visual, and helps highlight patterns over timeâ€”whether youâ€™re curious about border trends or just want to see how data can tell a story.

## ðŸŒŽ What it does

The dashboard lets you:
- View **drug and weapon seizures** on an interactive U.S. map
- Filter by **year** using a slider (2019â€“2025)
- Compare different **regions** based on seizure quantity
- Display **both drugs and weapons** in the same visualization

Built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) + [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) â€” no login or uploading required. Just run it locally and explore.
